# Agentic SDLC and Spec-Driven Development

Kiro-style Spec-Driven Development on an agentic SDLC

## Project Memory
Project memory keeps persistent guidance (steering, specs notes, component docs) so Antigravity honors your standards each run. Treat it as the long-lived source of truth for patterns, conventions, and decisions.

- Use `.kiro/steering/` for project-wide policies: architecture principles, naming schemes, security constraints, tech stack decisions, api standards, etc.
- Use local `AGENTS.md` files for feature or library context (e.g. `src/lib/payments/AGENTS.md`): describe domain assumptions, API contracts, or testing conventions specific to that folder.
- Specs notes stay with each spec (under `.kiro/specs/`) to guide specification-level workflows.

## Project Context

### Paths
- Steering: `.kiro/steering/`
- Specs: `.kiro/specs/`

### Steering vs Specification

**Steering** (`.kiro/steering/`) - Guide AI with project-wide rules and context
**Specs** (`.kiro/specs/`) - Formalize development process for individual features

### Active Specifications
- Check `.kiro/specs/` for active specifications
- Use `/kiro-spec-status [feature-name]` to check progress

## Development Guidelines
<!-- DEV_GUIDELINES: injected at install time with language-specific guidelines (npx cc-sdd@latest --lang <code>) -->
- Think in English, generate responses in Japanese. All Markdown content written to project files (e.g., requirements.md, design.md, tasks.md, research.md, validation reports) MUST be written in the target language configured for this specification (see spec.json.language).

## Minimal Workflow
- Phase 0 (optional): `/kiro-steering`, `/kiro-steering-custom`
- Discovery: `/kiro-discovery "idea"` — determines action path, writes brief.md + roadmap.md for multi-spec projects
- Phase 1 (Specification):
  - Single spec: `/kiro-spec-quick {feature} [--auto]` or step by step:
    - `/kiro-spec-init "description"`
    - `/kiro-spec-requirements {feature}`
    - `/kiro-validate-gap {feature}` (optional: for existing codebase)
    - `/kiro-spec-design {feature} [-y]`
    - `/kiro-validate-design {feature}` (optional: design review)
    - `/kiro-spec-tasks {feature} [-y]`
  - Multi-spec: `/kiro-spec-batch` — creates all specs from roadmap.md in parallel by dependency wave
- Phase 2 (Implementation): `/kiro-impl {feature} [tasks] [--review required|inline|off]`
  - Without task numbers: autonomous mode (subagent per task + independent review + final validation)
  - With task numbers: manual mode (selected tasks in main context, still reviewer-gated before completion)
  - `--review off` skips task-local review; use it intentionally and keep `/kiro-validate-impl {feature}` as the final quality gate
  - `/kiro-validate-impl {feature}` (standalone re-validation)
- Progress check: `/kiro-spec-status {feature}` (use anytime)

## Skills Structure
Skills are located in `.agents/skills/kiro-*/SKILL.md`
- Each skill is a directory with a `SKILL.md` file
- Use `/skills` to inspect currently available skills
- Invoke a skill directly with `/kiro-<skill-name>`
- Use skills explicitly requested by the user and skills relevant to the task's domain, including design, accessibility, and UX.
- Select skills from their descriptions or metadata first, then read only the selected skills and the references needed for the task.
- Follow explicit host and project rules and retain required workflow checks. Do not skip relevant skills just because the task is small.
- `kiro-review` — task-local adversarial review protocol used by reviewer subagents
- `kiro-debug` — root-cause-first debug protocol used by debugger subagents
- `kiro-verify-completion` — fresh-evidence gate before success or completion claims

Antigravity supports native subagents on documented 2.0 / CLI surfaces. Use the subagent tools available in the current session to give implementers, reviewers, and debuggers fresh contexts. If those tools are unavailable or disabled, run sequentially in the main context and report that the review was inline. Do not claim an independent review without a separate reviewer context.

New cc-sdd installs use `.agents/skills`. Existing `.agent/skills` installations remain supported by Antigravity. Before upgrading, reconcile customized skills and any same-named skills used by other agents; the installer does not move or remove the old directory.

## Development Rules
- 3-phase approval workflow: Requirements → Design → Tasks → Implementation
- Human review required each phase; use `-y` only for intentional fast-track
- Keep steering current and verify alignment with `/kiro-spec-status`
- Follow the user's instructions precisely, and within that scope act autonomously: gather the necessary context and complete the requested work end-to-end in this run, asking questions only when essential information is missing or the instructions are critically ambiguous.

## Steering Configuration
- For spec and implementation work, load the core steering files below from `.kiro/steering/`. Reuse current context rather than rereading unchanged files.
- Load additional steering only when required by project rules or relevant to the task.
- Default files: `product.md`, `tech.md`, `structure.md`
- Custom files are supported (managed via `/kiro-steering-custom`)
